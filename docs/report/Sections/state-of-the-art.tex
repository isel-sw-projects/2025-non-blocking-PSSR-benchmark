\chapter{Background and Related Work}

In this section, we first present the main properties that characterize each web
template technology approach, along with the advantages and drawbacks that result
from these characteristics. Then, in Subsection~2.2, we examine the different
design choices adopted by web servers in their internal architectures, and how
these choices impact the behavior of the web template engines.
