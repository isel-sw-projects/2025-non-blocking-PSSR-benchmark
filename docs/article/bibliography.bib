	abstract = {An important class of computer software, such as network servers, exhibits concurrency through many loosely coupled and potentially long-running communication sessions. For these applications, a long-standing open question is whether thread-per-session programming can deliver comparable performance to event-driven programming. This paper clearly demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to employ user-level threading for building thread-per-session applications without compromising functionality, efficiency, performance, or scalability. We present the design and implementation of a general-purpose, yet nimble, user-level M:N threading runtime that is built from scratch to accomplish these objectives. Its key components are efficient and effective load balancing and user-level I/O blocking. While no other runtime exists with comparable characteristics, an important fundamental finding of this work is that building this runtime does not require particularly intricate data structures or algorithms. The runtime is thus a straightforward existence proof for user-level threading without performance compromises and can serve as a reference platform for future research. It is evaluated in comparison to event-driven software, system-level threading, and several other user-level threading runtimes. An experimental evaluation is conducted using benchmark programs, as well as the popular Memcached application. We demonstrate that our user-level runtime outperforms other threading runtimes and enables thread-per-session programming at high levels of concurrency and hardware parallelism without sacrificing performance.},

  abstract = {We introduce Lazy Asynchronous I/O (LAIO), a new asynchronous I/O interface that is well suited to event-driven programming. LAIO is general in the sense that it applies to all blocking I/O operations. Furthermore, it is lazy in the sense that it creates a continuation only when an operation actually blocks, and it notifies the application only when a blocked operation completes in its entirety. These features make programming high-performance, event-driven servers using LAIO considerably easier than with previous interfaces.We describe a user-level implementation of LAIO, relying only on kernel support for scheduler activations, a facility present in many Unix-like systems.We compare the performance of web servers implemented using LAIO to the performance obtained with previous interfaces. For workloads with an appreciable amount of disk I/O, LAIO performs substantially better than the alternatives, because it avoids blocking entirely. In one such case, the peak throughput with LAIO is 24\% higher than the next best alternative. For in-memory workloads it performs comparably.},

  abstract="The Model-View-Controller design pattern is one of the most important design patterns in computer science. Whereas most patterns address specific problems, Model-View-Controller (MVC) describes the architecture of a system of objects. It can be applied to isolated subsystems or entire applications. The Model-View-Controller design pattern is also less clearly defined than many other patterns, leaving a lot of latitude for alternate implementations. It's more a philosophy than a recipe.",

	abstract="Progressive server-side rendering (PSSR) enhances the user experience by optimizing the first contentful paint and supporting incremental rendering as data becomes available. However, constructing web templates for asynchronous data models introduces complexity due to undesired interleaving between data access completion and template processing, potentially resulting in malformed HTML. Existing asynchronous programming idioms, such as async/await or suspending functions, enable developers to create code with a synchronous appearance while maintaining non-blocking progress. In this work, we introduce the first proposal for server-side rendering (SSR) web templates that seamlessly support the async/await pattern. Our proposal addresses the challenges associated with building SSR web templates for asynchronous data models, ensuring the production of well-formed HTML documents and preserving the capability of PSSR.",

	abstract="As the browser requests and receives the files needed for the webpage, it processes these files to extract the information it needs to begin building the webpage. The process of the browser building the webpage is known as rendering. During rendering, the browser converts all the files it has received and all the code it has processed into a functioning webpage. The last step of the rendering process is painting, or displaying, the webpage element by element. When the browser starts painting elements, visitors finally begin to see something on the website and are no longer looking at a blank screen.",
