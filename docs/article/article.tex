% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{Modern web applications increasingly demand rendering techniques that optimize performance, responsiveness, and scalability. Progressive Server-Side Rendering (PSSR) bridges the gap between Server-Side Rendering and Client-Side Rendering by progressively streaming HTML content, improving perceived load times. However, traditional HTML template engines often rely on blocking interfaces that hinder their use in asynchronous, non-blocking contexts required for PSSR. This work explores how Java Virtual Threads, introduced in Java 21, enable non-blocking execution of blocking I/O operations, allowing the reuse of traditional template engines for PSSR without complex asynchronous programming models. We benchmark multiple engines across Spring WebFlux, Spring MVC, and Quarkus using reactive, suspendable, and virtual-thread-based approaches. Results show that virtual threads allow blocking engines to scale comparably to those designed for non-blocking I/O, achieving high throughput and responsiveness under load. This demonstrates that Virtual Threads provide a compelling path to simplify the implementation of PSSR with familiar HTML templates, significantly lowering the barrier to entry while maintaining performance.}
